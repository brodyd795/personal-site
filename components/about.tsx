						<H3>{`My journey into software engineering`}</H3>
						<P>{`I grew up in small-town Iowa and headed to Iowa State University (Go, Cyclones!) after high school.
                            Didn't quite know what I wanted to do with my life at that point, but I quickly discovered a passion
                            for Spanish and Linguistics. I was fascinated at how structured human language is, and that drew me into a dual Spanish and Linguistics major`}</P>
						<P>{`By the end of my first year, I was introduced to programming. And so my career began!`}</P>
						<P>{`I spent the next three years dabbling in programming while I focused on my studies in Spanish and Linguistics. Mostly Perl and Python, of which I remember almost nothing üòÖ
                            But my interest continued to grow little by little.`}</P>
						<P>{`After graduating with my bachelors degrees, I continued my studies at ISU in a Master's program in Applied Linguistics. I was deeply interested in coding by this point, so I declared an emphasis in computational/corpus linguistics.`}</P>
						<P>{`In December 2018, I decided to make a career switch to software engineeering! Fortunately, my major professor had a background in software and agreed to help me in my journey.`}</P>
						<P>{`My breakthrough opportunity came a few months later when I was asked to teach an introductory course titled "Computers and Language" in the Linguistics program. I knew I wanted to teach my upcoming students how to use regular expressions,
                            so I decided to build a website for that purpose. It took me the full summer of 2019, but I did it!`}</P>
						<P>{`My first website was pretty awful in retrospect, but it fulfilled its purpose. It had ~150 total users over the course of the year, and I was able to make improvements to it to fit my students' needs.`}</P>
						<P>{`As I neared graduation, I got an interview with Hy-Vee and showed off my course website. It went pretty well! And after learning that Hy-Vee uses React, I spent the following Christmas break React-ifying my site to learn the skills for the job.`}</P>
						<P>{`Diving into the world of software engineering as a hobbyist was definitely a big change, but I haven't looked back. Fun stuff!`}</P>
						<H3>{`My Skills`}</H3>
						<P>{`Advanced: React, Next.js, Typescript`}</P>
						<P>{`Working proficiency: GCP, Postgres, Styled Components`}</P>
						<P>{`Learning: Golang`}</P>
						<H3>{`Outside of work`}</H3>
						<P>{`When I'm not working, I'm usually hanging out with my amazing wife and daughter. ‚ô•Ô∏è My wife is wonderful and has supported me throughout this whole journey, and my daughter has brought a whole new level of joy into our lives that we
                            never would've thought possible. We like playing games, walks on Iowa trails, and reading lots.`}</P>
						<P>{`If I'm not with them, I'm probably playing around with some new technology, trying my hand at woodworking, pretending I know how to golf, or reading.`}</P>
