	`I'm a software engineer at [Hy-Vee](https://hy-vee.com). 
	I grew up in small-town Iowa and went to Iowa State University 
	in 2014. I discovered a love for 
	Spanish and Linguistics pretty quickly (spoiler alert â€“ non-CS 
	background!), and I started working on the [CyWrite project](https://github.com/chukharev/cywrite), 
	an automated writing evaluation tool for ESL classrooms. I 
	picked up some beginner programming skills along the way and 
	graduated _suma cum laude_ with a B.A. in World Languages and 
	Cultures (emphasis in Spanish) and a B.A. in Linguistics.`,

	`Afterward, I started my M.A. in Applied Linguistics with 
	a focus in Computational/Corpus Linguistics. I quickly 
	discovered my passion for software development, which went 
	hand-in-hand with my linguistics training. I built [a course 
	website](https://github.com/brodyd795/course-website) to help my linguistics students learn regular 
	expressions, and I completed a round of [#100DaysOfCode](https://github.com/brodyd795/100-days-of-code). 
	While learning to code, I also taught elementary Spanish 
	to my 200+ students and completed [my Master's thesis](/thesis.pdf) on 
	L2 vocabulary acquisition and semantic relatedness.`,

	`At Hy-Vee, I work with front-end React + Next.js code, 
	back-end Node, and a smattering of other technologies in 
	our stack (Kubernetes, Elasticsearch, Styled Components...I 
	could go on).`,

	`I currently live in Iowa with my wife, Rachel, and our 
	daughter, Lillia. She's super cute ðŸ˜‰`
